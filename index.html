            <h2>Hiking</h2>
            <p>My love for hiking started when I was a little girl. Exploring trails with my family, ignited a sense
                of wonder and curiosity. Each new adventure filled me with excitement. Those early childhood
                experiences instilled a deep appreciated for the beauty of nature and those memories still inspire
                me to continue the journey.</p>
            <p>
                Hiking fills me with a sense of freedom and adventure. Each trail lets me explore the beauty that
                mother
                nature offers. I breathe in the fresh air, and escape the hustle of daily life. The feeling of
                accomplishment when reaching a summit or discovering a hidden waterfall is exhilirting. Hiking
                allows me to
                connect the environment and reconnect with myself.</p>
