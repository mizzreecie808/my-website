1. On the "10 essentials" page, card #8 scale is wonky, probably because you wanted it to scale with the picture on card #7.  I would pick a picture that matches aspect ratio, or edit the photos to match. 
2. I think you should list the trail that has the colorful mailbox somewhere on your website since now I want to go visit it.
3. At the top of the mailbox picture, there are these little specs that seem like they should be cropped out of the picture.
4. I could very well be mistaken, but I think the titles on these images might have been switched around.

FIXES MADE
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Cropped the 8-food.jpg image in order to provide better flow between the adjacent 7-shelter.jpg image.
2. Added text over the main image, "Mailbox Peak - North Bend, WA" in order to specify the location the picture was taken.
3. Cropped the mailbox-peak2.jpg image to remove the black spots that were there.
4. Swapped the descriptions of two gallery pictures. Mt. Kintoki and Mt. Townsend were switched.
